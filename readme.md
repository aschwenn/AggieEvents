# Aggie Events
This is the home of our Aggie Events high-fidelity design prototype intended to streamline the process of creating and finding student-led events on campus, as well as managing and discovering new student organizations to join. The current solution, Maroonlink, leaves a little to be desired in the way of efficiency and design. Currently, this application is just a wireframe--it would be pretty difficult for us to obtain access to the university's CAS login system and student activities databases, so for now, it's just a proof-of-concept.

The app was created in React Native, so it works on both iOS and Android devices. It can be tested as is by downloading NPM, cloning the repo and downloading all of the project dependencies, and running `expo start` or `npm start`. From there, one can test it on their own device by downloading the Expo Client app on the app store and scanning the QR code with their camera.
